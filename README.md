# MRI-Contrast-Prediction-Package
Provides the data preparation and model architecture for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast prediction as a Jupyter Notebook.
The architecture and the corresponding model is preliminary. Parts of the training data can be accessed by the followinf link: https://zenodo.org/record/7319761
For future developments, a webservice is planned to access and use the trained model, where users can upload their images along with the measurement parameters to predict the image with an alternative contrast.
